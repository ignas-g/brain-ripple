# BrainRipple

BrainRipple is a revolutionary platform that enables users to record their thoughts, mint them as NFTs, and use these thoughts to control their computers. Our platform leverages the power of Next.js, the XRPL blockchain, OpenBCI, and machine learning with Python to provide a seamless and innovative experience.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the BrainRipple platform, including:

- The Next.js web application for user interaction and managing the minting process
- The XRPL blockchain integration for minting and managing NFTs
- OpenBCI integration for capturing brainwaves
- Machine learning with Python for processing and recognizing thoughts

## Getting Started

To get started with BrainRipple, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:


bash
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BrainRipple.git```

2. Install dependencies:

bash
```
cd BrainRipple
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technical Design

### Next.js Web Application

We chose the Next.js framework for building the web application because of its performance, scalability, and server-side rendering capabilities. The web application allows users to:

- Record their thoughts using the OpenBCI helmet
- Upload the recorded thoughts
- Mint thoughts as NFTs on the XRPL blockchain
- Manage NFT ownership and payments

### XRPL Blockchain

The XRPL (XRP Ledger) blockchain is used for minting and managing NFTs. We chose XRPL due to its low transaction fees, fast confirmation times, and eco-friendly design. The platform integrates with the XRPL blockchain to:

- Mint thoughts as NFTs
- Manage NFT ownership
- Facilitate payments between users and BrainRipple for the SaaS subscription

### OpenBCI Integration

OpenBCI is an open-source platform for capturing and processing brainwaves. We use OpenBCI to record users' thoughts as they wear the helmet. The recorded data is then uploaded to the BrainRipple platform for further processing and recognition.

### Machine Learning with Python

We use Python and machine learning libraries to process and recognize users' thoughts. The processed thoughts are used to build a model that enables users to control their computers with their thoughts. This provides a hands-free and potentially more accessible way of interacting with a computer.
